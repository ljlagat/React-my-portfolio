Firestore Portfolio
This is a dynamic portfolio website where an admin can sign in to manage and display projects, skills, and a bio. The application uses Firebase for authentication and Firestore as the database for storing user data. The site is built using React and integrates with Firebase to allow real-time updates.

Features
Admin Dashboard: Admin can log in using Firebase Authentication and manage the portfolio content (projects, skills, bio).
Firestore Database: Data (projects, skills, bio) is stored and retrieved in real-time from Firestore.
Authentication: Admin must log in using pre-created credentials (no sign-up functionality).
Responsive: The portfolio is designed to be mobile-friendly and can be accessed across various devices.

Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
Firebase: Backend services for authentication and database (Firestore).
react-firebase-hooks: Firebase hooks to simplify Firebase integration with React.
Firestore: NoSQL cloud database to store the portfolio data.
CSS: For basic styling and layout.
